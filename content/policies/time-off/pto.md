## Overview

The Paid Time Off (PTO) policy combines vacation, personal, and sick time into a single flexible bank of days that employees can use for any purpose. PTO is designed to support work-life balance and provide flexibility for employees to take time away as needed.

## Eligibility

All full-time employees are eligible to accrue PTO. Part-time employees may be eligible for prorated PTO based on hours worked.

## Accrual

PTO accrues on a bi-weekly basis and is reflected on each pay statement. Accrual rates depend on years of service:

| Years of Service | PTO Days per Year |
|------------------|------------------|
| 0–1              | 15               |
| 1–5              | 20               |
| 5+               | 25               |

## Using PTO

- PTO must be requested and approved by your supervisor in advance, except for emergencies.
- PTO balances are visible in the employee portal.
- Unused PTO may be carried over, subject to state law and company maximums.

## State-Specific Notes
